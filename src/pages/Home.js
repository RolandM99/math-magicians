        Mathematics are the result of mysterious powers which no one understands,
        and which the unconscious recognition of beauty must play an important part.
        Out of an infinity of designs a mathematician chooses one pattern for
        beautyâ€™s sake and pulls it down to earth.

        Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will,
        the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection.
        Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction,
        generality and individuality.

        It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul&#128525;
