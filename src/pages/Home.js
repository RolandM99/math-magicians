        Mathematics are the result of mysterious powers which no one understands,
        and which the unconscious recognition of beauty must play an important part.
        Out of an infinity of designs a mathematician chooses one pattern for
        beautyâ€™s sake and pulls it down to earth.

        It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul&#128525;
